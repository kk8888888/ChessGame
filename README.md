Features

Cyberpunk Aesthetics: A dark theme with neon blue and pink highlights, reminiscent of a retro-futuristic world.

Dynamic UI: The game board and pieces have a glowing, "cyber" feel, with animations and visual effects.

Special Skills: Players can use unique abilities to alter the course of the game:

‚è≥ Time Freeze: Temporarily "freezes" the board with a visual effect.

üåÄ Quantum Swap: Inverts the colors of all pieces on the board.

üï≥Ô∏è Black Hole: Randomly removes a 3x3 section of pieces from the board.

"Emotional" AI: The AI opponent has one of two personalities, "aggressive" or "defensive," which affects its strategy.

How to Play

Objective: The goal is to have more of your colored disks on the board than your opponent by the end of the game.

Making a Move: Click on a valid highlighted cell to place your disk. A move is valid if it captures one or more of your opponent's disks.

Capturing: You capture your opponent's disks by "sandwiching" them between one of your existing disks and the one you just placed. All of the opponent's disks in the line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) will flip to your color.

Using Skills: Click on one of the skill buttons to activate a special power. You have a limited number of skill points.

Code Overview

The entire game is self-contained in a single index.html file, leveraging HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game logic.

HTML Structure

The HTML is straightforward, setting up the container for the game board and the skill buttons.

CSS Styling

The CSS is responsible for the game's cyberpunk look and feel.

--neon-blue, --neon-pink: CSS variables for the primary neon colors.

.cyber-container: A container with a dark background, rounded corners, and a neon border.

#board: A grid layout for the game board.

.cell: Individual cells on the board with a subtle glow.

.valid::after: A pseudo-element to create the pulsating pink indicator for valid moves.

.disk: The game pieces, styled with a box-shadow to create a neon glow.

.skill-btn: The skill buttons with a gradient background and a shining animation.

JavaScript Logic

The JavaScript handles all the game's functionality.

init(): Initializes the game state, setting up the initial four pieces on the board.

render(): Renders the current state of the board to the DOM, including the pieces and valid move indicators.

isValidMove(x, y): Checks if a move at a given coordinate is valid for the current player.

handleMove(x, y): Processes a player's move, flips the appropriate opponent pieces, and switches to the next player.

useSkill(skillType): Implements the logic for the three special skills.

EmotionalAI class: A simple AI that can have either an "aggressive" or "defensive" personality.

makeMove(): Decides the AI's next move based on its personality.

chooseAggressiveMove(): Selects the move that flips the most opponent pieces.

chooseDefensiveMove(): (In a more complex implementation) would choose a move that leads to a more stable board position.
